hello, today i want to compare two pictures!

1.)
In the first picture you see a trapped chicken. it doesn't seem to be very happy.
they are forced to produce eggs, and they are held together in huge cages, side by side
---
The second picture shows us the other side, a free-range husbandry. those chicken can move around as they want,
and seem to have more space when producing eggs. you see a lot of grass and the blue sky.

2.)
Both are forced to lay eggs, however there are very different circumstances
In both pictures we see chicken, but the ones in the second picture seem to be more happier. They are 
having more space and don't have to sit side by side

3.)
these photos deal with the wider topic of keeping chicken for our (human) demand. it should show, that 
it's not ethical to treat animals like objects. after they are exploited, they are handed over
to the slaughter house. on the other hand, it is more expensive to keep chicken 
on a huge ground and the collecting part is way more difficult. if every chicken lives like this, it wouldn't
be cheap for people to buy eggs.

4.)
In conclusion I have to say that a minimum standard of living for animals should be required.

today i want to talk about living in the city and living in the countryside. I've got two pictures
in front of me which are showing the main pros and cons and i want to compare both of them together.
on the left hand side (picture a) you see a no further specified city, which looks like the picture took
place most likely in the usa. there are just tall buildings, and a lot of concrete is shown on this picture.
the city is located near a river, with a bridge crossing it. this city seems to house a lot of people.
---
the second picture (b) shows a rather big house in a huge garden. in this garden in picture b you see a small
pond, lots of trees and bushes. this ground seems to be part of a rather small village with less people living
there. 

Dear debate club, i want to talk about my current personal living situation. no. no. no.
Right now i'm living in the starbucks of vienna.
